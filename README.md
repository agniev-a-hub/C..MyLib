# MyLib
This repository has been created as a first final test of my C skills. 

With my mentor, we have also created test instrument to make sure all my functions will work out. 

As I know, this library was a part of UNIT C course, but I have not attended it sadly. 

I'm very proud of this course completion and will continue to study C further.
